# Lottie JSON WaterMark Remover

This script allows you to remove specific layers from a Lottie JSON file, particularly the watermark layer from [LottieLab](https://www.lottielab.com). It is designed to clean up the watermark by removing the "Group Layer 8" from the Lottie JSON, which is where the watermark from LottieLab is typically stored.

## How it works:

1. **Upload your Lottie JSON**: Visit [LottieLab](https://www.lottielab.com) to create and download a Lottie JSON file with the watermark.
2. **Use the script**: Upload the downloaded JSON file into this tool, and it will remove the watermark layer (Group Layer 8).
3. **Download the cleaned Lottie JSON**: The script will generate a clean Lottie JSON file without the watermark.

## Features:

- Removes the "Group Layer 8" which contains the watermark from [LottieLab](https://www.lottielab.com).
- Easy to use through a simple interface: upload a JSON file, click to clean, and download the result.
- Allows you to get a free watermark-free Lottie file.

## How to Use:

1. Go to the page where the script is hosted.
2. Upload your Lottie JSON file by clicking the "Choose File" button.
3. Click "Clean JSON" to process the file.
4. Once the file is cleaned, it will automatically start downloading the new JSON without the watermark.

## Requirements:

- A modern browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
